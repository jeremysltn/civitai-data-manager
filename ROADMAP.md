# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned features and improvements for this project.

## 🚀 Upcoming Features

- **🔥 Manual Model Page**: Add a way for users to manually add models (via JSON file and directory scan). This is useful for models that were never available on Civitai but were downloaded elsewhere.
- **Handling Multiple `config.json`**: Implement the best way to efficiently handle multiple configuration files for testing and various use cases.
- **File Sorting**: Add an option to select the default type of sorting in the generated model browser, with the future possibility of configuring this through a `config.json` file.
- **Dark Mode**: Integrate dark mode in templates for a more user-friendly and customizable experience.

## 🛠️ Miscellaneous Improvements

- **Implement Logging**: Add better logging functionality to improve tracking and debugging processes.
- **Add Progress Tracking**: Integrate a progress bar to display the status of file processing, providing users with clearer feedback.
- **Code Refactor**: Clean up and move certain functions to a `utils` file to improve code structure and maintainability.
